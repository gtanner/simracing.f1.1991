  "description": "The Ferrari 643 was a Formula One car designed by Steve Nichols and Jean-Claude Migeot and was built by Scuderia Ferrari for use in the 1991 <br>Formula One season. Built during May and introduced at the French Grand Prix, it initially looked to have potential to run at the front. <br>Alain Prost qualified on the front row and took the lead, and although he was eventually passed by Nigel Mansell in his Renault powered Williams FW14, <br>a second place in the car&#39;s first race looked promising. Aside from almost always being on the front part of the grid, it was not to be however.<br><br>The chassis of the 643 was a total redesign over the 642 which suffered inconsistent handling issues, and was designed to allow for a more softer <br>suspension travel, as per Prost&#39;s request. The car also featured Ferrari&#39;s first &#39;raised nose&#39; design which allowed better airflow underneath the car. <br>The V12 engine was upgraded six major times during 1991, with the final evolution used from Portugal to the end of the season. <br>The chassis itself had two revisions, the first after the French Grand Prixâ€”which saw a relocation of the exhaust exits from underneath the car, <br>and Belgium which saw minor alterations to the body cover.<br><br>Although arguably one of the prettier cars in the field, the car was not as competitive as the Williams and McLaren cars of 1991.<br>A big problem with the car lay with a lack of correct data gathering due to the team&#39;s turbulent management structure at the time. <br>The car&#39;s results (or lack thereof) was one of the main reasons for the falling out between Prost and Ferrari, <br>with the Frenchman eventually saying that &#39;a truck would be easier to drive than this car&#39;. Following the Japanese Grand Prix, <br>Prost was fired for the second time in his F1 career by a works team. The team replaced him in Australia with test driver Gianni Morbidelli.",
